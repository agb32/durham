A 5-day fully-funded summer school aimed at PhD students interested in changing the way they work to enable a move to Net Zero. The school will provide training and skills to help empower attendees to make real positive environmental change.




## Registration

We welcome applications from any UK based PhD student whose PhD research involves the use of computational or data facilities. The school provides practical training in sustainable practices but also has a strong emphasis on creating advocates for sustainable DRI. Applicants should therefore have a willingness and interest in becoming such an advocate. Applicants will be selected to represent a range of research areas, covering the different research councils within UKRI.

## Accommodation, Travel and Funding

The summer school is located at the University of Durham and accommodation has been arranged at the Marriott Hotel in central Durham.

Accommodation will be provided to all successful applicants free of charge. Reasonable travel expenses will be also be funded.  We anticipate all applicants will travel by train and consider their environmental footprint when travelling. 

We recognise that this may be challenging for some individuals and should not be a barrier to participation, alternative forms of travel are appropriate to meet individual circumstances.
