# NetDRIVE Summer Schools

We are running two fully-funded [NetDRIVE](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/netdrive) summer schools for PhD students, focused around Net-Zero and responsible research when using Digital Research Infrastructure.  These will be during the summer of 2026, and spring of 2027.

If you would like to be notified when the application form goes live, please enter your details [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=i9hQcmhLKUW-RNWaLYpvlKHkTxd26sdLkOaQl2zCEXpUNVpGQVpVSzRTVlBCQTlTTVFWVkhWTTVFWi4u){:target="_blank"}.

## Background

The UK is committed to being Net Zero by 2050 but achieving this requires positive environmental action from everyone. This includes researchers and those that enable this research.

Within the UK our rich Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI) provides world-class facilities for researchers, ranging from high performance computing (HPC) systems and large-scale data facilities through to local clusters and desktops. Changing the way we utilise these facilities is crucial to achieving a Net Zero DRI.

We seek applications from UK based PhD students whose research utilises compute and/or data. Applicants should be keen to make a change to the way they work to reduce emissions and to advocate for change within their communities.


There is some good content [here](https://epcced.github.io/2025-05-13_GreenHPC_Edinburgh/index.html#key-concepts) which may help set the scene.

## Summer School Experience and Skills Development

The summer school blends keynote speakers and practical hands-on training to empower and motivate attendees, while also providing key skills and knowledge. A running theme throughout the school will be a series of communication and skills sessions, training students to communicate their message in a meaningful way, to advocate for change. 

## How to apply

We welcome applications from any UK based PhD student whose PhD research involves the use of computational or data facilities. The school provides practical training in sustainable practices but also has a strong emphasis on creating advocates for sustainable DRI. Applicants should therefore have a willingness and interest in becoming such an advocate. Applicants will be selected to represent a range of research areas, covering the different research councils within UKRI. 

## Organisation

The summer school is funded by the UKRI NetworkPlus activity, NetDRIVE. It is organised by Durham University, EPCC at the University of Edinburgh and NCAS.
