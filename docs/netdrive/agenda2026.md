## Wednesday (AM): Connecting emissions with research

### Wednesday 09:00 - Talk: Societal, environmental and economic benefits verses environmental cost and CO2 offsetting

The balance between science and research outputs, and the environmental cost of HPC can be difficult to achieve, or even determine.  This talk will discuss the societal considerations, the economic benefits of more compute verses the environmental cost, and how we should think about this topic.

### Wednesday 09:30 - Talk: Monitoring and estimating emissions in your workflow, Alex Owen

Most large HPC facilities will have ways in which the energy consumed by jobs can be estimated and reported, with direct calculation of carbon emissions then possible.  This talk will discuss how these emissions can be monitored and estimated within different workflows.

### Wednesday 12:30 - Lunch

## Wednesday (PM): Influencing data centre sustainability and procurement

### Wednesday 13:30 - Keynote: UKRI procurement, TBC

Procurement of HPC systems is complex, and often rushed in non-ideal conditions.  This talk explores the process, and opportunities for input into system designs, and how environmental credentials can be a key part of th eprocess.

### Wednesday 14:00 - Talk: Understanding the procurement process

An ongoing discussion of procurement, with examples from various large HPC systems.

### Wednesday 14:30 - Talk: Sustainable data centres
