Info to follow.

## Agenda

The agenda is yet to be confirmed by the bus company.

- 8:00 Departure from Department of Computer Science; participants can leave their luggage in the bus

There will likely be 2 return times, around lunch time, and evening.

We will collect preferred variants of participants upon departure, but it is the participants' own responsibility to arrive at the pick up points on time.


## Insurance and risk

Hiking is a risky activity. 
Participants join the trip on their own risk, i.e. the organiser is not liable.
We will collect emergency contact information and any medical information to pass on to paramedics upon departure.
Good footwear and waterproofs, as well as sufficient water and snacks are recommended.

## Further participants

We might have the opportunity to fill empty spaces on the bus with spouses and friends. Please contact the organisers ahead of time.
