Theme description to follow.

<!-- Call for presentations
---------------------- -->

We invite proposals for talks, typically 15-25 minutes long, which will be embedded into a wider programme hosting invited speakers and vendor presentations. Suggested topics of interest for this conference include (but are not limited to):

* Advanced in AI- and simulation-driven domains enabled through HPC installations
* Optimisation of HPC, AI and ML workloads to deliver increased efficiency and scaling on HPC machines
* Use of novel technologies, techniques and architectures to deliver improved energy efficiency
* Software, programming, and algorithmic approaches for reducing power consumption by codes
* The convergence of AI/ML and HPC applications and algorithms
* Success stories around efforts to encourage Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) in the HPC workforce
* Approaches to user training
* How we are able to share hardware designed for AI/ML with HPC and vica-versa
* Going beyond the batch system, for instance the use of interactive computing such as Jupyter notebooks, on traditional HPC machines
* HPC centre policy to enable non-traditional workloads
* Lessons learnt from energy efficient HPC centre operation

As HPC is a large community that encompasses many different roles, we welcome both technical and non-technical contributors at all career levels to submit their work in order to broaden the knowledge of all those who attend our event. We also invite colleagues to get in contact wit the organisers if they want to organise a minisymposium (typically 4 or 8 talks).

Submission details
------------------

We request submission of an abstract, approximate length 300 words which will be peer reviewed via the EasyChair system at [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hpcdays26](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hpcdays25).

**Successful presentations will be required to register and attend the conference in-person.**
