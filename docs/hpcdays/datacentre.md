# Data centre tours

We will offer short tours of the main University HPC data centre, which hosts the Tier-1 DiRAC facility.

The data centre is a 10 minute walk from the conference venue, and involves climbing up a steep hill on return.

Please sign up for a tour at the welcome desk.  Then grab some lunch and make your way to the main entrance - we will depart from there at around 12:40, and return before 13:30.
