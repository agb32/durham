# Globus

Globus is widely used by HPC systems to transfer data between systems.

It has a concept of a [research data portal](https://docs.globus.org/guides/recipes/modern-research-data-portal/) which is a design pattern for providing secure and high performance access to research data.

## Subscriptions

Globus offers a free subscription tier for limited control of data transfer.  However, higher performance transfers are available with a paid subscription.

There is potentially some issues related to commercial companies having University accounts (e.g. spin-offs and close collaborators) who would then have access to Globus through a University subscription.  The details here need to be ascertained.  Similarly, how the transfer of data to commercial partners can be managed needs to be determined.
