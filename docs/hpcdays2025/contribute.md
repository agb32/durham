# How to contribute to the webpages

We appreciate help of colleagues to keep our pages up-to-date and consistent, and to add any missing information. To make a contribution

- Create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
- Fork the [repository](https://github.com/agb32/durham). The fork should end up in your own account.
- Create a new branch and make your changes there.
- Commit your changes.
- Issue a pull request against the master repository/branch.
- Your pull request will be reviewed at the earliest convenience, we will provide feedback, and eventually merge the updated changes into the master repository.
